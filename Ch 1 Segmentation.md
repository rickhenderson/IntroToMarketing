# Designing a Customer-Driven Marketing Strategy
*These notes are based on Chapter 7 of Marketing: An Introduction, Updated Sixth Canadian Edition*

The four aspects of a customer-driven marketing strategy are:
* market segmentation
* targeting
* differentiation
* positioning

Look at a company like Proctor and Gamble (P&G). They have some of the world's most valueable brands and are leaders in the field of branding. They invented brand management (Armstrong, 2018). Both Luvs and Pampers are owned by P&G. Why would the company create two different products that compete with each other instead of focussing on one? The reason is **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)">positioning</a>**.

A marketer (you, in many cases) selects the customers that you are going to serve by using **segmentation** and **targeting**.

Once this is completed you move on to your **value proposition**. This is done through **differentiation** (how is your product different, and how/why are you better than your competitors) and then **positioning** (arranging a space in the market where customers will *figuratively* see your product) (Armstrong, 2018).

# Bases of Market Segmentation

* Segmenting Consumer Markets
  * geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioural variables (Armstrong, 2018, p.241).
  * segmenting in these ways allows the marketer to "understand key customer segments, target them more efficiently, and tailor market offerings and messages to their specific needs" (Armstrong, 2018).
* Segmenting Business Markets
  * buying **behaviour** and **benefits** may be the best choices for segmenting business markets
* Segmenting International Markets
  * can be segmented by **geography**, **economic factors**, **political and legal factors**, and **cultural factors**
  * Mexico is often ignored, Canada and the US are not the same, and not everyone in South America speaks Spanish.

   defines value differently.

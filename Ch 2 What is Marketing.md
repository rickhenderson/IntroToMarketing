# What is Marketing?

Marketing can be seen as the managing of profitable relationships with customers (Armstrong et al.). 
*"The twofold goal of marketing is to attract new customers by promising superior value and to keep and grow current customers by delivering satisfaction"* (Armstrong et al., p. 6).

```
*marketing mix*: a set of marketing tools that work together to satisfy customer needs and 
                 build customer relationships
```
Marketing engages, understands, develops, provides, prices, distributes, and promotes.

## Core Concepts
Marketing is about meeting customer needs.
The 5 Core Concepts are:
* (1) needs, wants, and demands; (2) market offerings (products, services, and experiences); (3) value and satisfaction; (4) exchanges and relationships; and (5) markets.

*market myopia*: getting lost in products and forgetting about the needs and experience of customers

A product is just a tool for solving a problem.

*market*: A market is a set of actual and potential buyers for a product, service, or idea.

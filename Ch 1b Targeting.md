# Market Targeting
Once the market has been **segmented**, the marketer must decide which segment to go after or **target**.

**target market**: a set of buyers who share common characteristics that the company chooses to serve

There are four marketing strategies:

Undifferentiated (mass marketing) > Differentiated (segmented) > Concentrated (niche) > Micromarketing (local or individual)

## Choosing a Targeting Strategy
Topics to consider:
* company resources
* product variability
* market variability
* competitor's marketing strategies

## Socially Responsible Target Marketing
It's important that marketing be done responsibly with respect to different target groups, most notable children. Concern lies over topics such as 11 year olds buying Pink clothes by Victoria's Secret, to *advergames* which appear on mobile apps and may attract young children that are not able to discern the impact or purpose of marketing. The largest problem however is with unscrupulous advertisers.

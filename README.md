These notes come from my personal recorded notes while I attended lecture as a student and are not copies of information provided by the instructor or copied from textbooks. 

Quotations are properly attributed using APA citations (or soon will be) and completely follow fair use and used for informational purposes.

# Definition
As a basic definition of marketing, so we know what *exactly* it is we are talking about we'll use
"managing profitable customer relationships" (Gary, pg. 3). However the aim of marketing is really to "create value for customers and to capture value from customers in return" (Gary, pg.3).

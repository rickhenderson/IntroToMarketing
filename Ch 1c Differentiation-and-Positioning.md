# Differentiation and Positioning
How do companies differentiate and position their products (in the minds of customers) for maximum competitive advantage?

*"A productâ€™s position is the complex set of perceptions, impressions, and feelings that consumers have for the product **compared with competing products**."* (Marketing, 2018, p. 260)

## Positioning Maps
Example: Vertical Axis: Price, Horizontal Axis: Orientation (Luxury > Performance)

## Choosing a Differentiation and Positioning Strategy
Differentiate along:
* product
* services
* channel
* people
* image (brand)

## Finding a Value Proposition

## Developing a Positioning Statement
A <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/write-brand-positioning-statement/">positioning statement</a> sums up the brand and company positioning in a statement of the form:

```
To (target segment and need) our (brand) is (concept) that (point of difference).
```
OR
```
(Brand) is a (1) company that provides (2) with (3) by (4).

```
Where 
1. is the category in which the brand operates (<a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/write-brand-positioning-statement/">Smith, 2016</a>).
2. is target audience.
3. is the benefit to the customer.
4. is the reason why the brand will deliver on it's promise.

## Communicating and Delivering the Chosen Position

After a company chooses it's position and target markets, it must use its **marketing mix** to communicate these to the target consumers.

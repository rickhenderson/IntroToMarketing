# Differentiation and Positioning
How do companies differentiate and position their products (in the minds of customers) for maximum competitive advantage?

*"A productâ€™s position is the complex set of perceptions, impressions, and feelings that consumers have for the product compared with competing products."* (Marketing, 2018, p. 260)

## Positioning Maps
Example: Vertical Axis: Price, Horizontal Axis: Orientation (Luxury > Performance)

## Choosing a Differentiation and Positioning Strategy
Differentiate along:
* product
* services
* channel
* people
* image (brand)
